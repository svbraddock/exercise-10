## CSS: Web Fonts


### Objectives

- Use (Google) web fonts.


### Instructions

Clone this repository by clicking "Clone or Download". Select "Download ZIP".

Included in the `exercise-10` (or `exercise-10-master`) directory are the following files:

- README.md (this file)
- css
  - style.css
- index.html

Do not move any files outside of these directory.

**Never copy and paste code; always type it in by hand.**


### Tasks

All work needs to be done in the `exercise-10` folder. (It may be named `exercise-10-master`.)

Before you begin styling, make sure your HTML [validates](https://validator.w3c.org).

1. Visit [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and select two well-paired fonts. One font will be for your body copy, the other for your headings. Feel free to play around with different combinations. Whatever you choose, make sure all copy on the page is readable.

2. Customize the heading font to use a weight of 700 or greater (bold, extra bold or black).

3. Add the font to your style sheet.


### How to tackle this project

Decide what you need to do, one step at a time.

Write down each task as you go. When you complete it, check it off. Decide on the next task to tackle.

Once you get into marking up content within the body, it is okay if you get stuck. Set aside that task and move on to another. Note the item you struggled with (so you can spend time on it later) and keep moving forward.

### Am I done?

Again, it is not expected for you to complete this exercise in class. If you finish, have your professor give it a look. If you are finished, re-download the repository files and go through the fixes again. Practice, repetition is an excellent way to learn.

### Why isn't X working?

Before asking for help, try working through the problem first. Refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

When something does not appear to work as you expect, ask yourself:

- Did I forget to close a tag?
- Are there typos in element, attribute, value names?
- Did I forget to include quotes around attributes?
- Are my file names, directory paths correct?
- Does my code validate?
- Are there typos in my file name?
- Is the file in the correct directory?
- Is my style sheet properly linked?
- Are my selectors correct?
- Do my properties exist? Are there typos?
- Does the property accept the value I am giving it?
- Is all my CSS punctuation there?

Remember, you can always refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

**Good luck!**
